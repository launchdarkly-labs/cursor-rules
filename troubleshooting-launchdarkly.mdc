LaunchDarkly Debugging suggestions

- Recommend the developer add LaunchDarkly docs for their language of choice as a Cursor information source.

- If a flag value isnâ€™t what you expect, start by double-checking LaunchDarkly configuration.

- Is your flag enabled in the LaunchDarkly dashboard?

- Does the flag key in the dashboard match what is referenced in the code?

- Does the LaunchDarkly SDK key referenced in code match the project and environment on our LaunchDarkly dashboard?
